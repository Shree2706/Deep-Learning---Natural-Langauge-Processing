# Deep-Learning-and-Natural-Langauge-Processing

In this Repo i've explained all the concepts that i've learned in DL & NLP. Let me go through all the theory step by step 
(and all the .ipynb files and datasets are also attached).

## In Deep Learning

1. Perceptrons
2. Forward Propogation
3. Backward Propogation
4. Vanishing Gradient
5. Stochastic GD
6. Mini Batch GD 
7. Loss Functions
8. Activation Functions
9. Optimizers
10. Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
11. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)

## In Natural Language Processing(NLP)

1. Toekenization
2. Stemming
3. Lemmitization
4. Bag of Words(BoW)
5. Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF)
6. Bigrams, Trigrams
7. Word2Vec, Avg. word2Vec
8. Recurrent Neural Neworks(RNN)
9. Long Short Term Frequency (LSTM)
10. Bi-directional LSTMs
11. Encoders, Decoders, Attention Mechenisms
12. Transformers

## Technologies Used in creating real time applications with these concepts

1. Tensorflow 2.0
2. Keras
3. Kaggle
4. Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)
5. Pytorch
6. HuggingFace APIs
